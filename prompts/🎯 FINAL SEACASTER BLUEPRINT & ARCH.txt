1️⃣ CORE GAME MECHANICS
The Fishing Loop (30-Second Cycle)
text
STEP 1: THE CAST (3 seconds)
├─ Player sees ocean view with fish shadows at various depths
├─ Flick/swipe up gesture (mobile) or click-drag (desktop)
├─ Rod bends, line extends with physics
├─ Bobber lands with splash + ripple animation
└─ Visual feedback: "Nice cast!" or "Perfect!" based on distance

STEP 2: THE WAIT (5-15 seconds)
├─ Bobber floats with gentle wave animation
├─ Underwater view shows fish shadows approaching
├─ Tension builds with ambient sound
├─ Random wait time creates anticipation
└─ Visual cue: Bobber starts shaking violently

STEP 3: THE CATCH (1-2 seconds)
├─ "!" appears above bobber
├─ Splash sound + water eruption
├─ Timing window: 0.5-2 seconds (varies by rarity)
├─ SUCCESS: Tap/click → Reel animation → Fish caught
├─ MISS: "Fish got away!" → Line goes slack
└─ Display: Fish species, size, rarity, XP earned

STEP 4: THE REWARD (5 seconds)
├─ XP bar fills (+10 to +500 XP)
├─ Floating "+50 XP" text animation
├─ Fish added to session catch log
├─ Level up? → Celebration animation
└─ Return to Step 1 (if casts remain)
Total Loop: ~30 seconds per cast = Highly addictive rhythm

Tournament Economics (YOUR OPTIMIZED VERSION)
Tournament	Entry	Participants	Total In	Prize Pool	Winner	2nd	3rd	Your Cut
Daily	$0.50	60	$30.00	$30.00	$18.00	$7.50	$4.50	$6.00 (20%)
Weekly	$2.00	75	$150.00	$150.00	$90.00	$37.50	$22.50	$30.00 (20%)
Boss Battle	$7.99	31	$247.69	$247.69	$148.61	$61.92	$37.16	$49.54 (20%)
Special Event	$10.00	Variable	Variable	80% of pool	60% pool	25% pool	15% pool	20% of total
Championship	$50.00	200	$10,000	$10,000	$6,000	$2,500	$1,500	$2,000 (20%)
Corrected Calculation:

You're taking 20% of entry fees, not 10%

Prize pool = 80% of total entries

Top 3 split that 80% (60% / 25% / 15%)

This is BETTER margin for sustainability

🎯 RISK MITIGATION
Potential Issues & Solutions
Risk 1: Bot Farming

Mitigation: Farcaster FID verification, tournament skill gates, rate limiting

Detection: Abnormal catch patterns, inhuman reaction times

Response: Ban accounts, refund legitimate players

Risk 2: Low Tournament Participation

Mitigation: Free entries at milestones, varied times, push notifications

Backup: Reduce min participants, combine tournament types if needed

Risk 3: Wallet Integration Friction

Mitigation: Clear onboarding, video tutorial, Base Pay SDK (3 clicks)

Alternative: Play free without wallet, prompt when claiming prizes

Risk 4: Season Pass Not Selling

Mitigation: Free trial (3 days premium), referral discounts, bundle deals

Pivot: Lower price to $6.99, or monthly $3.99 option

Risk 5: Marketplace Not Active

Mitigation: Seed marketplace with starter rods, featured listings, trading events

Alternative: NPC buy-back program (we buy rods at 50% value)
